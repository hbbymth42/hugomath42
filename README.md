# Hugomath42
Hugo Theme for Personal Website!

## Features
Not too many at the moment outside of what is available by default when creating a new Hugo Theme. Hopefully this will change soon!

## Installation
Follow the [Hugo Docs' Quick Start](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) Guide to install Hugo.

Once you have created a new site, continue to follow the aforementioned guide but replace the 'anake' theme with this one by doing the following:

Clone this theme into the `themes` directory, adding it to your project as a Git submodule.
```shell
git submodule add https://github.com/hbbymth42/hugomath42.git
```

As per the Quick Start Guide, append a line to `hugo.toml`, indicating this theme.
```shell
echo "theme = 'hugomath42'" >> hugo.toml
```

## Configuration
Simple configuration by altering the default `hugo.toml` file to add different menus/tags. For further information, see the [Configure Hugo Guide](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration/).
